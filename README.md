# **PROJECT / BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING**

H&M Group, a global fashion conglomerate with a vast online presence and numerous physical stores, faces a common challenge in the e-commerce worldâ€”providing customers with personalized product recommendations. The aim of this project is to enhance the shopping experience for H&M Group's customers by leveraging machine learning and data science techniques to create accurate product recommendations. Furthermore, this initiative aligns with sustainability goals by reducing returns and minimizing emissions associated with product transportation.

The ultimate goal of this project is to improve the shopping experience for H&M Group's customers by providing personalized product recommendations. Successful solutions will not only enhance customer satisfaction but also contribute to sustainability efforts by reducing returns and minimizing emissions.

As such, the project's aim is to develop a recommendation system that can suggest products that users will very much buy in the near future. The primary task in this challenge is to predict the articles that each customer is likely to purchase during the 7-day period immediately following the training data. It's important to note that customers who do not make any purchases during this period are excluded from the scoring. Therefore, the focus is on improving recommendations for active customers.
